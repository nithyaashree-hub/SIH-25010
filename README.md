## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
<h3>The proposed system is a Smart Crop Advisory Platform that leverages IoT sensors, satellite data, and AI-based analytics to provide personalized crop recommendations for small and marginal farmers.</h3>
<ul><li>Proposed Solution

The Smart Crop Advisory System is an AI-driven platform designed to provide personalized crop recommendations and real-time advisory services for small and marginal farmers. The system integrates soil analysis, weather forecasting, and crop disease detection to help farmers make informed decisions for better yield and profit.
</li>
<li>How it addresses the problem

This solution tackles key farming challenges such as low productivity, unpredictable weather, and lack of expert guidance. By analyzing soil nutrients, weather conditions, and market trends, the system suggests the most suitable crops, optimal sowing times, irrigation schedules, and preventive measures for pest/disease management. It reduces dependency on middlemen and provides direct, data-driven advice to farmers, improving efficiency and profitability.
</li>
<li>Innovation and uniqueness of the solution

The innovation lies in combining AI-based predictive analytics with IoT sensors and mobile accessibility. Unlike traditional advisory methods, this system uses real-time data from soil sensors and satellite weather updates to give location-specific recommendations. A multilingual mobile app ensures farmers can access guidance in their local language, making it inclusive and user-friendly. Additionally, the integration of market price forecasting helps farmers plan the best time to sell their produce for maximum profit.

## Technical Approach
<h3>The platform will be built using:</h3>
<ul><li>Technologies to be used

Programming Languages:

Python – for AI/ML model development (crop prediction, disease detection).

JavaScript (React.js) – for building the farmer-facing web dashboard.

Flutter / Kotlin – for cross-platform mobile app development.

Frameworks & Libraries:

TensorFlow / Scikit-Learn – for predictive analytics and machine learning models.

Node.js & Express.js – for backend API development.

OpenWeather API – for real-time weather data integration.

Database:

MongoDB – to store soil data, farmer profiles, and crop recommendations.

Hardware (Optional for advanced version):

IoT Sensors (Soil pH, moisture, temperature) – to collect real-time soil and environmental data.

Raspberry Pi / Arduino – to connect sensors and transmit data to the cloud.
</li>
<li>Methodology and Process for Implementation

1. Data Collection & Preprocessing

    Gather historical crop yield, soil data, and weather patterns.

    Clean and preprocess datasets for model training.

2. Model Development

    Build AI/ML models to predict the best crop, fertilizer needs, and irrigation schedules.

3. Sensor Integration (if IoT-based)

    Connect soil sensors to collect live data and send it to the backend server.

4. Backend & API Development

    Create REST APIs to process inputs and return crop advisory recommendations.

5. Frontend Development

    Design a farmer-friendly mobile app and web dashboard with multilingual support.

6. Testing & Deployment

    Test the system with real field data and deploy on AWS / Azure Cloud for scalability.
